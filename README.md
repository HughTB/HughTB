### Hello There!

I'm Hugh, a final year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Portsmouth

I love working with hardware, developing software, tinkering with my homelab and messing about with Linux on my personal machine. Most of my work (that's not under grading or licence restrictions) is open-source right here

- You can reach me on Discord at [@hughtb](https://discordapp.com/users/403609667722412054) or by email at contact@hughtb.uk
